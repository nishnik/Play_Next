Have you ever felt lazy? Not talking about extremity but I don't like changing songs one after other when they finish playing. I repeat I don't like opening a new tab and then searching for a song after which I play it **only when** the current song ends playing.
<br/>This chrome extension is a dark knight for people like us. Now you can add songs from whichever tab you want even when the current song is playing and like an obedient **queue** it will play each song one after other.

Well words are deceiveing, lets see the extension in action:
